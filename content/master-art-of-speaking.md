This is some list of lessons or important points in no particular order from
[The Secret Habits to Master Your Art of Speaking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43397364-bicara-itu-ada-seninya)
book I read a while ago.

- Do not boast when making a first impression.
- Make a positive first impression because there are no second chances in
conversation.

### Communication Rules

- Words that cannot be said "in front" should not be said "behind".
Gossip is very bad.
- Speak less and listen more.
- Speak words that please the heart, not just words that sound good.
- Say what the person you are talking to wants to hear, not what you want to say.
Speak in a way that is easy to understand.
- Talk about pleasant things, not annoying things.
- Nonverbal communication also involves the eyes and facial expressions.
- Be responsible for what has been said because the words that come out will
control us.

Talk and act as if you have already succeeded. Speak as if it has already
come true.

C = Q x P x R

Communication = Question x Praise x Reaction

Asking questions shows interest in the person you are talking to.

Detailed praise can bring about a positive reaction.

Give feedback in an enthusiastic tone.

### Practice Logical Speech

- Give logical reasons for our arguments.
- Be mindful when making conclusions and statements. Avoid leaps in logic, which
means making conclusions that are not based on facts or evidence.
- Be consistent with our arguments or opinions from start to finish.
- Use simple words.
- Stay calm and avoid getting upset when speaking.

### Expressing Oneself Through Storytelling

Do not spend too much time listing your qualifications during an interview.
Storytelling will cover up your weaknesses and make you more valuable.

Storytelling exercises are very useful for improving communication skills.

- It must have a prominent theme. The story told must be consistent with one theme.
- Create conflict that immerses people in the story.
- A story must be familiar and easy to understand in order to attract sympathy.
- Can resolve conflicts with solutions.
- Create a storyline that can provoke curiosity and concentration. But use it
appropriately.
- A reason that makes the story believable.

### Tips to Overcome Nervousness

- Pretend that the audience is not there to judge us but rather to listen to our
stories with excitement.
- Avoid underestimating your self-capacity when introducing yourself.
- Learn the content well.

### Nonverbal Elements

- A good look for a first impression.
- Always smile and stay calm.
- A steady gaze.
- Confidence, like posture.
- Appropriate gestures, such as hand gestures, to show strong intent.

Establishing good product value to compete with large competitors. And set
values that match the quality of yourself.

Focus on one thing for marketing. For example, restaurants focus on the
authentic taste of their dishes for customers. Focus on what you are good at.

Prioritize consumer needs over desires.

A need refers to an urge for something that is fundamentally necessary. And know
the problems of the person you are talking to.

1. Situation Question: Questions to find out consumers' opinions about the
situation they are facing.
2. Problem Question: Information from the Situation Question can be used to
understand problems, difficulties, and needs.
3. Implication Question: Asking what negative effects the problem has on the
family, health, and life.
4. Needs-payoff Question: We provide solutions and introduce our products as one
of the alternatives.
