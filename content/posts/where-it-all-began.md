Hi! Welcome to my first post. In this post, I will cover all the things why I
made this site, so hopefully it will give you an insight into everything
with a detail about it.

## Why Blogging?

I believe this will be a common reason why most people also started a blog: it's
sharing. Whether sharing their knowledge, experience, or even their hobbies. All
those things are also the reason why I've started to made one. I would like to
share any knowledge or tips that I got, as well as any topics or ideas that I
may come up with for this blog.

I started the first blog in 2023, but back then I archived and discontinued to
fix and improve things on my website because I felt unsatisfied by my own expectation.

Blogging inspired me from everyone who love to share their problems with a
solution and any kind of knowledge. This brings me to share my knowledge by
writing a post in a clear and understandable way.

This blog was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I ever tried using Cloudflare Pages,
but it seems a bit much for me so if I need to host static site, I would choose
GitHub Pages.

"Why not WordPress?"; "Why not Astro/Hexo/Jekyll?"; there are a few things why.

First, I need to mention why not just WordPress or any other commercial CMS?
People know it's free, easy to get started with drag and drop, click here and
there, and a lot of plugins and themes. But even though it's free, the advanced
features are limited with a paid plan, and you don't have full control of how
your website works under the hood.

Just like any other SSG (Static Site Generator) such as Astro and Hexo, Hugo
it's for a static site, meaning there is no server-side processing involved
(except hosting the site) so it's less vulnerable to security risks. In
addition, Hugo is fast, well maintained, and has a large community.

## What Will You Expect From This Blog?

The topics I will cover on this blog can be varied. Anything that I would like
to write from ideas that are going through. But most likely it will be topics about
Linux and a few tips about various subjects that non-tech savvy can apply.

I'm expecting that I will post at least one post either every one or two months,
and hopefully the content will bring something useful to you as a reader.

## How I Maintain This Blog?

I maintain this blog as much as I care about my writing skills. To make it less
boring and complex, I will provide a simple explanation for each topic, so
both native and non-native English speakers can easily understand my word choices.

## Challenges I Faced

The challenges of writing a post on the blog are only one thing: my English
skill issue. Sometimes I need help with translators and [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)
to fix my grammar. So if you are reading this as a native English speaker, you
get the point of why and how I write. Regardless of that, I'm always trying
to improve the language, which is also quite challenging for a non-native
English speaker like me.

So that is the end of this post. Thanks for reading until the end. If you have
any ideas or suggestions, drop me an [email](mailto:wwiyoko@protonmail.com),
I'm glad to answer it!
